# **Squared Media Rig UI**

**Squared Media Rig UI** is a Blender add-on designed to streamline rigging and animation workflows by providing an intuitive user interface for controlling rigs. Tailored for animators and riggers, this add-on simplifies the management of rig properties, such as bone controls, IK/FK switching, and custom attributes, making it ideal for projects requiring efficient animation pipelines, such as those by Squared Media.

## Features

- **Customizable Rig UI**: Create a user-friendly interface in Blender’s 3D Viewport to control rig properties.
- **Bone Management**: Easily toggle bone visibility, manage bone collections, or adjust rig settings.
- **Animation-Friendly**: Designed to enhance animation workflows with quick access to controls.
- **Integration with Blender**: Compatible with Blender’s rigging systems, such as custom armatures or popular add-ons like Rigify.

## Installation

1. **Download the Add-on**:
   - Clone this repository or download the ZIP file from the [Releases](https://github.com/Fxnarji/squared-media-rig-ui/releases) page.
2. **Install in Blender**:
   - Open Blender and navigate to `Edit > Preferences > Add-ons`.
   - Click `Install` and select the downloaded ZIP file (e.g., `squared-media-rig-ui.zip`).
   - Enable the add-on by checking the box next to “Squared Media Rig UI.”
3. **Dependencies**:
   - Ensure Blender 3.0 or later is installed.

## Usage

1. **Access the UI**:
   - After enabling the add-on, select your rig in Blender’s 3D Viewport.
   - Open the Sidebar (`N` key) to find the “Squared Media Rig UI” panel.
2. **Configure Rig Controls**:
   - Use the panel to toggle bone visibility, switch between IK/FK modes, or adjust custom properties.
   - *(Add specific instructions, e.g., “Select a bone to access its custom properties” or “Use the picker for quick bone selection.”)*
3. **Animation Workflow**:
   - Leverage the UI to streamline keyframing and rig manipulation for faster animation production.
